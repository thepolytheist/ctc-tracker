# CTC Tracker
## Purpose
This application was designed due to love of sudoku and Cracking the Cryptic. While it's easy enough to get daily puzzles from their Discord, tracking which videos I've been able to follow along with has been a more difficult challenge and one that seemed primed for a software solution.

## Authentication
Using the YouTube API currently requires [getting a data API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) and setting it for the `CTC_API_KEY` environment variable. Not doing so will result in an error.
